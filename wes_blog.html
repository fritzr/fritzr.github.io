Found a TileSet that might be used for the final game. It depends on how everyone feels about the artwork. I created a map using the TileSet in the program called Tiled. I uploaded the tmx file, the json file, and the TileSet to FileZilla. This means my group can essentially open the tmx file with Tiled and see if they like the map,and if they do, it will be updated into the game.

Helped make some changes to GameState.js like adding in this to literally everything.
I found some explosion spritesheets.
I helped fix some collision problems.
Found a way to store info between states, I think.

Explosions work for enemy ship and ship. Just need to make image background clear.
