modified the game code to actually run with the game states framework.<br/>
GameState.js will now actually load a semi-playable version of the game instead of simply throwing errors.<br/>

created a level one to be used.<br/>

Created upgrades and completed the Upgrades game state. I made global variables that certain parameters of gameplay will depend on.<br/>
I created a new button sprite sheet for the upgrades. I developed the in game experience system so the player will be able to purchase upgrades.<br/>
I fixed the locations of the objects in the Upgrades.js so that they will not randomly change location after completion of the first level.<br/>
I fixed the explosion sprite sheet so that it has a transparent background. I created another tile map that can be used for a level. <br/>
I fixed the fire rate for the player so that it is not able to fire infinitely fast.<br/>
Added upgrades for the light radius of the ship and moved where the loading bar in the loading screen is located.<br/>
Tested game play and fixed many minor bugs.<br/>
Removed the backgrounds from the buttons.<br/>
Updated certain aesthetic elements of the game to make it look cleaner: such as fonts used in game states and locations of text. <br/>
