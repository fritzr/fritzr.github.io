Created upgrades and completed the Upgrades game state. I made global variables that certain parameters of gameplay will depend on.<br/>

I fixed the locations of the objects in the Upgrades.js so that they will not randomly change location after completion of the first level.<br/>
I fixed the explosion sprite sheet so that it has a transparent background. I created another tile map that can be used for a level. <br/>
I fixed the fire rate for the player so that it is not able to fire infinitely fast.<br/>
Added upgrades for the light radius of the ship and moved where the loading bar in the loading screen is located.
