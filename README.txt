Structure of Code:

We defined an enemy class which contains a set list of places where they can spawn at, controls all the different scenarios associated with collision, and the bullets for the enemy. 

Each level is a different state, so when one level is beaten, it goes on to the next.



Most of our images used in the project are loaded in the preloader state.

We used tilemaps to generate the map.

Used raycasting for lighting on ship.


How to play:

Use the mouse to control the ships movements.

click to shoot.

Whatever direction the ship is facing the lighting goes, and it does not go through walls.

You basically just traverse the maze, and kill ships as you progress. Each ship is worth money, and at the end of each level you can buy upgrades for your ship.
Upgrades include increase fire rate, and increase angle of vision.
